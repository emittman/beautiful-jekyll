# My professional journey
I am Data Scientist holding a PhD in Statistics from Iowa State University. I enjoy working real-life Data Science problems (understand > conceptualize > data acquisition > data prep > model > analyze)
and discussing all aspects of this process with interested parties.
I find that while no two problems are alike, the experience of having worked through many of them provides me with intuition about how to begin and then proceed.
What brings me satisfaction is when my client understands the results of my work and has the information that enables them to move forward.

## Intel (2018-2025)
For the past 7+ years I was a Statistician and then a Data Scientist at Intel, Ronler Acres Campus.
I worked under several different org structures, but always within the same core team in Logic Technology Development.
Our team had a number of distinct responsibilities. We helped integrators engineers design experiments, train/help them with data analysis and prototype tools for automating routine analyses.
I defined SPC (statistical process control) best practices and trained engineers, to interact with Intel's SPC systems. Because of this I had a key role in defining the roadmap for improvements to those systems.
Our team owned tens of an evolving list of statistics and software classes spanning from introductory level stats to applied machine learning classes in tree ensembles and neural nets.
I was a gating reviewer of 1000s of whitepapers per year.

Time management was critical, but there was freedom to identify and work on projects provided that the expected ROI could be shown. I enjoyed the variety problems that I saw.
Through my initiative, I was able to do hands-on learning about a variety topics that were new to me, including such things as:
- Gaussian process
- Penalized B-Splines
- functional regression
- measurement error models
- orthogonal N-D polynomials
- image processing
- SQL
- Python

### Remote work
In 2020, all of those at the company that didn't need to physically be in the factory went remote, myself included. I missed going to in-person meetings, going to the company gym and seeing many, many familiar faces.
Ronler Acres is a massive place and I could end up walking miles in the course of a day.
The flip side of course, is that zero commute time enabled a lot more time where I could be getting desk work done and providing on-line assistance to engineers.
In any case, I adjusted to the new reality and found new daily patterns that allowed me to be highly productive while still looking after my well-being.
By spring of 2024, due to personal circumstances, I requested to be allowed to work fully remote on a permanent basis to allow my family to move back to Iowa, near our parents and siblings.
In July, I was given notice that all remote work was going to be disallowed, and despite consistent positive quarterly reviews, I was being laid off.
While this came as a bit of a surprise, I knew that substantial head-count reduction was coming and that the new CEO felt a return-to-work policy was necessary, so I had been mentally preparing for it.

## Iowa State University (2013-2017)

### Research
As a graduate student, I use computationally intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samping methods to fit (hierarchical) Bayesian models. Some of this work was done using software libraries, such as rstan and jags in R, but I also targeted GPUs which required much lower level programming. To do this I called cuda libraries from C++ with an R wrapper. This was quite a learning curve since I am a self-taught programmer outside of CompSci 101 and a fantastic Introduction to R class (required at ISU). Hierarchical models are a particular way of improving inference when the set of unknowns you are interested in is very high dimensional and the Bayesian approach enables principled quantification of your uncertainty in that inference.
